///The abstract definition(declaration) of the properties and methods in the Protocol are common processes to all of the classes which confirmed the protocol!!
///We can override these Protocol's properties and methods with detailed definition  in a certain class which confirmed the protocol. These  detailed overriding are specific process only for the class itself.
///We can also override them with detailed definition in the Protocol extension. They are common processes.
///Override in the Class is primitive to the Protocol.
